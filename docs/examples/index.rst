Running the Examples
--------------------

**Jupyter Notebooks**
  All examples are available as interactive Jupyter notebooks in the ``examples/notebooks/`` directory.

**Python Scripts**  
  You can also run the examples as standalone Python scripts.

**Online Viewing**
  Examples can be viewed directly in the documentation without running code.

Getting Started
---------------

If this is your first time using Mammoth Lite, start with:

1. :doc:`basics` - Learn the fundamental API and workflow
2. :doc:`custom_model` - Create your first custom continual learning algorithm

Prerequisites
-------------

To run the examples, you need:

* Mammoth Lite installed (see :doc:`../installation`)
* Basic Python knowledge
* Understanding of PyTorch fundamentals
* Familiarity with machine learning concepts

Some advanced examples may require additional packages that will be noted in the individual example descriptions.
