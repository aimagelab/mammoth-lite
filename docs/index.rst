Mammoth Lite is a lightweight and simplified version of the `Mammoth <https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth>`_ framework for continual learning research. This version prioritizes ease of use and minimal dependencies while maintaining the core functionality for developing and testing continual learning algorithms.

.. warning::

    Mammoth Lite is designed for **didactic purposes** and to provide a simple and clean interface for experimenting with continual learning algorithms. It should not be used for academic research or development. For that, you should refer to the complete `Mammoth <https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth>`_.
